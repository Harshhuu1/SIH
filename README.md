# SIH Mentorship and Job-Seeking Platform

Welcome to the **SIH Mentorship and Job-Seeking Platform** project! This platform was developed during the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) to bridge the gap between job seekers and mentors, providing career guidance and mentorship opportunities.

## Features (In Progress)

- **Home Page**: A user-friendly landing page that highlights the platform's purpose and features.
- **Mentorship Opportunities**: A section for users to explore mentors in various domains.
- **Job Listings**: A feature to browse job openings relevant to different skill sets.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile users.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: To enable interactive elements on the website.

## Current Limitations

- **No Sign-In/Sign-Up System**: Authentication and user accounts are yet to be implemented.
- **No Backend**: The project currently runs on the front end only, and no server-side functionality is present.
